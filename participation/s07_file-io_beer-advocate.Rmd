```

The dataset contains 3 variables:

  1. Beer category
  2. Average alcohol by volume (ABV) in percentage (%)

You should write a script to do the following:

  1. Download the dataset with an appropriate filename.
  2. Import the dataset into R.
     Be sure to check for any importing problems and correct as needed.
  3. Make a figure illustrating the relationship between ABV and beer quality.
  4. Compute a summary table with the mean and SD of each variable, along with their correlation.
  5. Describe the results.
