<!-- First, your YAML metadata block at the top of the file (where title, author, output, etc. are, needs to begin _and end_ with three hyphens like below. -->
<!-- Second, see how suboptions on the YAML (like the different types of 'output' need to be indented by two spaces. -->

I used the Palmer penguins dataset to find the means of the bill length,

<!-- R code needs to be entered into code blocks. Right now, this is being treated as regular text. See how I edited it below.  -->

```{r}
length <- c(39.1, 39.5, 40.3, 36.7, 39.3, 38.9, 39.2, 34.1, 42)

mean(length)

depth <- c(18.7, 17.4, 18, 19.3, 20.6, 17.8, 19.6, 18.1, 20.2)

mean(depth)

sd(depth)

mean(depth, trim = 0.1)

flipper <- c(181, 186, 195, 193, 190, 181, 195, 193, 190)

range(flipper)

flipper < 190
```

<!-- When you knit the file, you want to look at the output and see that it looks correct. In your knitted html and md, it just shows the R code, but not any results, because the R code wasn't in a code block and so wasn't actually run. -->
